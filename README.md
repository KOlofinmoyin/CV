| <a href="http://routearound.herokuapp.com/">Route Around </a> | My group delivered the route-around web app., on time and to budget :laughing: A circular route geeneration app. for the urban runner/ dog walker. I enjoyed delivering key story-points on the project, also assisting with coordinating the background workflow of the project; cheering on every achievement; from the minutest marker drop from googlemaps directionService, to the sheer brilliance of other team-mates.

|<a href="https://github.com/robertwoolley99/acebook-greenbook">Acebook - Greenbook </a> | The Greenbook team delivered their Makers group project as specified by Product Owner of the Facebook web app. (using agile principles) The project essentially exercised how well we worked to client specification, but the team stuck in and seized the opportunity (frequently groping in the dark) to deliver something pretty decent.
